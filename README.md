# Tutankabot - Mechatronics Project


**Project Group: Group 4**
**Academic Year: 2021-2022**

## Overview

Welcome to the Tutankabot Mechatronics Project repository! This project focuses on the development of an autonomous robot, and this README provides an overview of the project's structure and key components.

## Project Structure

- **/Code_final/:** This directory contains the complete source code deployed on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

- **/Botfinal_Quartus/:** The source code used for flashing the De0-Nano can be found here.

- **/Report/:** Explore the 'Report' directory to access various reports that detail the robot's design and development process.

- **/communications_protocols/CAN/:** Inside this directory, you'll find a README file that provides basic information about the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol and its implementation within the project. 

- **/Path_Planning/:** This directory includes a README file explaining the functionality and usage of the path planning system employed in the project.

- **/Other folder/:** These directories hold code snippets developed during the project's development stages before integration into the final codebase. These snippets may offer simpler insights into specific functionalities but might have undergone changes in the final version.
